A front-end only web
This web basically consists of two dices.
If the value of the dice on the left is bigger than the one on the right, then the header component will generate the text "Player 1 Wins!". If it's the other way around, the text will become "Player 2 Wins!"
If the dice value are same on both dices, then it will be a draw.
